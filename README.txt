=================================== Tic-Tac-Toe ===================================

This program is an implementation of one of the most popular games, Tic-Tac-Toe,
which can be played by 2 players by simply running the main function.

A frame should pop with the board displayed as a 3x3 table. Each of the 2 players 
take turns by clicking on the specific tile they choose to lay their sign on, 
without being able to post modifications to it.

If the game ends in a win/draw for either of the players, a dialog will be displayed
with the a label to reset the game and 2 options available (yes || no).

Should be decided to reset the game, press YES and the board will reset to its normal
state. Otherwise both the dialog and the main frame will close with the exit code 0

If at any point the frame is close, the program will exit with code 0. The same goes
for the dialog, should it be closed.
